## Ideas

As a guide, below is a list of features / projects I want to include.

- [x] Use subdomains as different server and project. The main AWS instance will just be camospecs.uk but a different instance could be   example.camospecs.uk

- [x] For the blog part of the site, I want to be able to just past the contents of my Obsidian MD pages. On my part, this means ensuring assets (like images) are contained within the same directory when making pages.

- [ ] I'd like to create a network monitoring tool that looks at and posts interesting facts about the traffic to the site (country, bots etc).
    
- [x] A dark purple theme?
    
- [ ] Blogs will be categorised. I should be able to make categories on the fly and not have 3 or 4 that are just set in stone...
    
- [ ] Literally anything can be posted. From book reviews to techy stuff.

- [x] Site needs to be appealing on most screen sizes.

- [x] A page dedicated to future projects. (This one?)

- [ ] Write a book review on The Revenant.

- [ ] Write a book review on Into The Wild.

- [ ] Make my own todo app, hosted on a EC2 instance. Also make a writeup about it.

- [ ] Make a resume page.
