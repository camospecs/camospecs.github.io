I'm Matthew, or as I like to call myself, `camospecs`. This site is an effort of mine as a way to keep track of all my happenings (a [digital garden](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/])
). You may see

- My 3D prints.
- A list of hikes I've completed.
- Reviews.
- Guides. For myself or that I feel are helpful for others.
- Coding projects.
- Content, configs and ramblings about my homelab.
- Running plans, gym plans, big project plans or anything that will help me stay accountable.
- Cheatsheets.
- Deep dives into specific topics.
- Anything else!?

I also talk to myself a lot - something that this site is all about. 

Please enjoy!
