Welcome to my blog! You can find all sorts of content here from write up from my technical projects to guides on fire making.

If you want to talk about any of my posts (or anything at all really), feel free to contact me via my email [me@camospecs.uk](mail:me@camospecs.uk) or by messaging me on [Github](https://github.com/camospecs).

Enjoy!

P.S. Just want to really thank all the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/graphs/contributors) conrtributors who have helped make this theme. Without them, this blog wouldn't be nearly as appealing to look at.
